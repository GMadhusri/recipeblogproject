<h1> Taco Bar</h1>
  <img src="https://cdn.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/taco-bar-580x844.jpg" width="50%" height="400">

 <h3> Ingredients</h3>
  2 (14-ounce) packages O Organics® Extra-Firm Tofu
  ¼ cup avocado oil
  1 (1-ounce) package O Organics® Fajita Seasoning Mix
  4 bell peppers, stemmed, seeded, and sliced into strips
  1 small red onion, sliced into wedges
  O Organics® Extra-Virgin Olive Oil CookingSpray, for the grill
  Juice of 1 lime, plus wedges for serving
  8 O Organics® White Corn Tortillas, , warmed
  1 avocado, sliced
  Sliced jalapeños
  Fresh cilantro, for garnish
  Green Chile Vegan Ranch Sauce:
  1 cup Open Nature® Slivered Almonds
  ½ cup plus 2 tablespoons water
  1 (4-ounce) can O Organics® Green Chiles
  2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
  ½ teaspoon O Organics® Dried Dill
  ½ teaspoon O Organics® Garlic Powder
  ½ teaspoon O Organics® Onion Powder
  ½ teaspoon sea salt
<h3>Instructions</h3>
Press the tofu. Wrap each block of tofu in a kitchen towel or paper towels. Place a heavy cast iron skillet on top and let it sit for 30 minutes. This helps squeeze excess water out of the tofu, which keeps it from sticking to the grill.
Make the sauce. Place the almonds, water, green chiles, lime juice, dried dill, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt in a high-speed blender and blend until creamy. Chill until ready to use.
Preheat a grill to medium-high heat.
Cut each tofu block into 4 slabs and place on a tray or plate. Drizzle the tofu with half the avocado oil and sprinkle with half the fajita seasoning. Use your hands to coat both sides.
Place the peppers and onions in a large bowl and toss with the remaining avocado oil and fajita seasoning.

 <h3> Ingredients</h3>
⅔ cup all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled
¼ cup cornstarch
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon paprika
½ teaspoon sea salt
¾ cup water
1 head cauliflower, about 2 pounds, broken into large florets

Preheat the oven to 450°F and line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and salt. Add the water and whisk until smooth. Add the cauliflower and stir to coat.
Lift the cauliflower florets out of the batter, allowing any excess batter to drip back into the bowl. Arrange in a single layer on the prepared baking sheets and bake for 10 minutes. Use a spatula to carefully flip the florets. Bake for another 10 minutes, swapping the pans on the oven racks.
Remove the cauliflower from the oven and brush with some of the buffalo sauce. Bake for another 12 to 15 minutes, or until the cauliflower is dark and crisp around the edges.
Remove from the oven and brush with additional buffalo sauce. If desired, serve with vegan ranch for dipping.
